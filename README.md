# there are 5 projects available here;

1) Simple loop example

2) Self implemented both mutable and immutable versions of Scala List implementations, which are created by "not" using Scala's built-in lists.

3)Again Self implemented mutable version of the Scala's Set implementation

4)Self implemented Hash-Set by using basic types collections like arrays and "not" using Scala's built-in collections. In this project i've used "Linear Probing" approach to have a fast access, and used "Universal Hashing Algorithm" to linearly distribute each entry.

5)After learning higher order functions, and Options type in Scala, 3 different types of operations are implemented...
